## Usage

1. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
2. Enter the plaintext message in the designated input field.
3. Set the shift value (key) using the provided input field.
4. Click the "Encrypt" button to perform the encryption.
5. The encrypted message will be displayed in the result textarea.
6. Optionally, click the "Copy Text" button to copy the encrypted message to the clipboard.

## Features

- User-friendly interface.
- Real-time input validation and feedback.
- Copy encrypted text to clipboard functionality.
- Utilizes the Caesar Cipher algorithm for encryption.

## Installation

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
https://github.com/basmasalim/Caesar-Cipher-Encrypt.git
```

## Dependencies
- Bootstrap
- Font Awesome
- SweetAlert2

Ensure that these dependencies are properly linked in the HTML file for the tool to function correctly.

## How it Works
The tool uses the Caesar Cipher algorithm to encrypt a given plaintext message. The user provides the plaintext message and a shift value (key). The algorithm then shifts each letter in the plaintext by the specified key to generate the encrypted message.
